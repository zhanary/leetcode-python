In Python, every value is a reference, you can say a pointer, to an object. Objects cannot be values. Assignment always copies the value; two such pointers point to the same object.


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        cur = head
        while cur:
            while cur.next and cur.next.val == cur.val:
                cur.next = cur.next.next
            cur = cur.next
        return head
